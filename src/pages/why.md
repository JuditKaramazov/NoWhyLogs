Judit LÃ¡zaro Moyano, also known as [Judit Karamazov](https://karamazfolio.xyz), is a Front-end developer, Spanish philologist, and tightrope walker.

If you can't get to find her in some nearby cafeteria, she'll definitely be hiding behind the digital walls of her analysis, apps, or poetry. As video games, literature, and music are her fuel, Judit raised a little pseudo-creature, which she happens to call a blog: [karamaBlog](https://karamablog.xyz), James Bond style. Strange, isn't it? Sometimes, she also sings forgotten songs in the shape of [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/JuditKaramazov).

## But why?

This space focuses on offering a better insight on the creative process of crafting video games as a solo developer: 'No Why Games'. All the news regarding the stack, improvements, or reflections on the course of events, will be expressed here.

Just like the rose, a game is without 'why'; it blooms simply because it blooms. So be it, then.
